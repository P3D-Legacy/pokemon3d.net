    | - AbstractAPI: This driver uses AbstractAPI to check if an email address is a spam address.
    |               @see https://www.abstractapi.com/email-verification-validation-api
    | - QuickEmailVerification: This driver uses QuickEmailVerification to check if an email address is a spam address.
    |               @see https://quickemailverification.com/
    | - Verifalia: This driver uses Verifalia to check if an email address is a spam address.
